# Xamboarding
This repo contains libraries to help enable XAML based applications with onboarding capabilities

## What is Xamboarding?
Xamboarding is a framework to enable onboarding in your XAML based applications such as WPF, UWP, UNO, Xamarin (MAUI) etc. The framework is extensible to customize the views and intended to reduce the repetition work for setting up onboarding in applications.

## How can I contribute?
Contributions are welcome! The first cut is around WPF on .NET core. Extending/Porting this to UWP, UNO and MAUI potentially down the road.
